## Summary

## 1. Business Understanding
Credit risk modeling is essential for lenders to assess the likelihood that a borrower will default on a loan. Machine learning techniques can be a powerful tool for credit risk modeling because they can identify complex patterns in data that would be difficult to identify with traditional methods. By using machine learning to predict loan default, lenders can make more informed decisions about whether or not to approve loans and at what interest rate. This can help lenders to reduce their risk of loss and improve their profitability.
